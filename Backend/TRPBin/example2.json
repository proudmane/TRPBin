Things can and WILL get better.\n\nDO NOT DO SOMETHING PERMANENT OVER SOMETHING TEMPORARY, NO MATTER HOW BAD IT GETS.\n\nYou're better than that.\n\nIf nobody has told you today-- no, even if they have-- you're awesome and I love you.\n\nI am always here to lend an ear or a fluffy hug in the span of mere seconds, do not forget this. Even if I look busy, if you need somebody to talk with, hit me up with a whisper.\n\nI have been in your shoes one too many times before, and if there is one thing I have learned...you don't have to go through it alone.\n",
